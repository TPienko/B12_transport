The *.dat files contain the information on the contacts formed between Cbl and BtuB, root-mean-square fluctuations (RMSF) of Cbl during its permeation simulated with GF-SA-US and conventional US.
The *.zip files comprise the energy of interaction between Cbl and BtuB during its permeation simulated with GF-SA-US and US, as well as the PMFs calculated from cumulative data during GF-SA-US simulations.

The data.zip file comprises the time-series of:
  A) the extension of the luminal domain vs the relative position of Cbl in z while the constant-velocity / constant-force SMD simulations of simultaneous unfolding of the luminal domain and release of Cbl (Force*.dat- the file title indicates the constant force (in kcal/mol) imposed on Cbl)
  B)

The *.prmtop file contains parameters and topology, the *.pdb file contains coordinates of the system, the *.xsc file contains the PBC information
The *.namd file provides configuration for running SMD in NAMD
The *.tcl scripts are used to perform SMD simulations using TclForces module in NAMD
